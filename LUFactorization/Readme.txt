This function takes the input of a coefficient matrix and from that matrix it
creats a lower triangular matrix, upper triangular matrix, and a pivot
matrix in order to solve.
   Input: 
       A = coefficient matrix
   Output: 
       L = Lower triangular matrix
       U = Upper triangular matrix
       P = The pivot matrix
